# staticanalysis
Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without 
actually executing programs (analysis performed on executing programs is known as 
dynamic analysis). In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of the source 
code, and in the other cases, some form of the object code.
This repository is in support of the authors Masters Thesis on the effectiveness of 
Static Analysis tools, techniques, and frameworks.

## description
Folders at this level contain sample code for common categories of Java programming 
errors, as well as additional libraries _(lib)_ for resources required by various 
demonstrations. 

### categories
1) **Alias**: where errors may occur when an object is referenced, without consideration 
for mutations caused by an alias to the same object.
2) **Init**: where any object that is accessed at runtime prior to being fully 
initialised will cause an error.
3) **InvokeDynamic**: where type-checking is usually performed at runtime and therefore
prone to misuse of type errors.
4) **Nullness**: where dereferenced expressions are a common cause a null pointer 
exceptions.
5) **Signedness**: where signed and unsigned values are incorrectly mixed together in a
computation, and meaningless operations occur such as division on an unsigned value. 
6) **Taint**: where certain parts of an application, using a tainted value can 
compromise the applicationâ€™s integrity, causing it to crash, corrupt data, leak private 
data, etc.

Each folder contains slightly modified different versions of the same code. The base 
version is raw unannotated code. Other versions, indentified with an underbar suffix, 
contain annotations for various static analysis tools such as _Checkerframework_. 
Versions include;
1) **Checkerframework** _(suffix: \_cf)_

### libraries
The library folder contains JAR files for additional tools and frameworks such as _JUnit_,
and _Checkerframework_.
