# staticanalysis

Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without 
actually executing programs (analysis performed on executing programs is known as 
dynamic analysis). In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of the source 
code, and in the other cases, some form of the object code.

The sophistication of the analysis performed by tools varies from those that only 
consider the behaviour of individual statements and declarations, to those that include 
the complete source code of a program in their analysis. The uses of the information 
obtained from the analysis vary from highlighting possible coding errors (e.g., the lint 
tool) to formal methods that mathematically prove properties about a given program 
(e.g., its behaviour matches that of its specification).
