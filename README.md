# staticanalysis
Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without 
actually executing programs (analysis performed on executing programs is known as 
dynamic analysis). In most cases the analysis is performed on some version of the source 
code, and in the other cases, some form of the object code.
This repository is in support of the authors Masters Thesis on the effectiveness of 
Static Analysis tools, techniques, and frameworks.

## description
Folders at this level contain sample code for common categories of Java programming 
errors, as well as additional libraries _(lib)_ for resources required by various 
demonstrations. 

### categories
1) **Checker Tests**: Checker Framework annotated test cases.
for mutations caused by an alias to the same object.
2) **Annotated Checker Tests**: Checker Framework annotated test cases.

### libraries
The library folder (lib) contains JAR files for additional tools and frameworks such as 
_JUnit_, annotated javac distributions, and checker tools.
