# alias
Two expressions are aliased when they have the same non-primitive value; that is, they 
are references to the identical Java object in the heap. Errors may occur when an object
is referenced, without consideration for mutations caused by an alias to the same object.

## description
Provide a template to test the effectiveness of static analysis tools in identifying 
unintentional mutations of objects that were intended to be unique.

### test objectives
Identify where objects that are intended to be unique may become mutable by;
1. direct assignment of an alias, 
2. referencing an existing alias, 
3. pseudo assignment of an alias to method parameters, or
4. leakage to an alias via method return value.

## checker framework
There are two possible types for an expression:
1. **@MaybeAliased** is the type of an expression that might have an alias. This is the 
default, so every unannotated type is @MaybeAliased. Includes the type of null.
2. **@Unique** is the type of an expression that has no aliases. The @Unique annotation is 
only allowed at local variables, method parameters, constructor results, and method 
returns. It is not allowed on fields, array elements, and type parameters. A 
constructor’s result should be annotated with @Unique only if the constructor’s body does 
not create an alias to the constructed object.

There are also two annotations, which are currently trusted instead of verified, that can 
be used on formal parameters (including the receiver parameter, this):
1. **@NonLeaked** identifies a formal parameter that is not leaked nor returned by the 
method body. For example, the formal parameter of the String copy constructor, 
String(String s), is @NonLeaked because the body of the method only makes a copy of the 
parameter.
2. **@LeakedToResult** is used when the parameter may be returned, but it is not 
otherwise leaked. For example, the receiver parameter of StringBuffer.append(StringBuffer 
this, String s) is @LeakedToResult, because the method returns the updated receiver.
