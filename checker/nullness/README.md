# nullness
Nullness checking guarantees that a program will never throw a null pointer exception. 
De-referenced expressions are a common cause a null pointer exceptions. Dereferences occur not only 
when a field is accessed, but when an array is indexed, an exception is thrown, and more. Such 
exceptions may also occur simply as a result of a field not being initialised by its constructor.

## description
Provide a template to test the effectiveness of static analysis tools in identifying potential 
causes of null-pointer exceptions.

### test objectives
When the following issues occur for an expression that may never be null;
1. assignment to an uninitialised object,
2. directly de-referenced with null,
3. assignment to a null reference,
4. assignment to null via a method return value,
5. assignment to an uninitialised object of an under-initialised class, or
6. assignment to an uninitialised object of an under-initialised extended class.

## checker framework
The nullness hierarchy contains these qualifiers:
1. **@Nullable** indicates a type that includes the null value. For example, the type Boolean is 
nullable: a variable of type Boolean always has one of the values TRUE, FALSE, or null.
2. **@NonNull** indicates a type that does not include the null value. The type boolean is 
non-null; a variable of type boolean always has one of the values true or false. The type @NonNull 
Boolean is also non-null: a variable of type @NonNull Boolean always has one of the values TRUE or 
FALSE — never null. Dereferencing an expression of non-null type can never cause a null pointer 
exception.

The Nullness Checker supports several annotations that specify method behavior. These are 
declaration annotations, not type annotations as they apply to the method itself rather than to 
some particular type:
1. **@RequiresNonNull** indicates a method precondition: The annotated method expects the specified 
variables (typically field references) to be non-null when the method is invoked.
2. **@EnsuresNonNull**
3. **@EnsuresNonNullIf** indicates a method postcondition. With @EnsuresNonNull, the given 
expressions are non-null after the method returns; this is useful for a method that initializes a 
field, for example. With @EnsuresNonNullIf, if the annotated method returns the given boolean value 
(true or false), then the given expressions are non-null.

## findbugs

**Unwritten field (UwF - UWF_UNWRITTEN_FIELD)**

This field is never written.  All reads of it will return the default value. Check for errors (should it have been initialized?), or remove it if it is useless.

**Unread field (UrF - URF_UNREAD_FIELD)**

This field is never read.  Consider removing it from the class.
